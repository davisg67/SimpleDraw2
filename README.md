# SimpleDraw2
HTML5 Canvas drawing example.

Includes drawing tools similar to MS Paint such as a pen, line tool, spray paint and eraser. A color picker allows you to make additional color choices for your drawings. A line width tool allows you to adjust line widths and you can include shapes such as a square, rectangle, circle or oval. A slide out tool section keeps for a clear drawing area and when you are done you can save your work to a pdf file.

Ok, it's not quite on par with MS Paint, but the purpose was to work with the HTML5 canvas element and see what could be done. The live version can be seen here. http://79.170.40.37/gregdstestdomain.com/draw2/
